AI-powered summarization assistant for neuro diverse learners.Individuals with ADHD and learning disabilities such as dyslexia often struggle to absorb information from lengthy videos and lectures. Traditional note taking methods can be challenging, leading to difficulties in retaining key information. This project aims to address these challenges by developing an AI-powered assistant that can summarize large educational videos/lectures, generate concise notes, and create quizzes to aid learning for individuals with ADHD and learning disabilities.
